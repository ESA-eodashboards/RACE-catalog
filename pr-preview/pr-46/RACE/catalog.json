By mapping daily precipitation at 1-kilometre resolution, it helps people understand rainfall patterns that influence floods, droughts, agriculture, and water availability. The dataset is developed by the CNR IRPI Hydrology Group and supports monitoring of extreme weather and climate impacts.",

Soil moisture is essential for agriculture, water management, and understanding drought risk. By tracking changes in soil moisture over time, this indicator helps people see how landscapes respond to rainfall, dry periods, and climate variability, supporting awareness of water availability and environmental conditions.",
