  "ShortDescription": "This indicator shows how many trucks were moving on major European motorways, using satellite images taken between 2020 and 2021. By detecting the unique signature that moving vehicles leave in Sentinel-2 imagery, it provides a broad view of freight traffic across the EU. This helps us understand how goods were moving during periods of disruption, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and offers insight into how resilient our transport and supply chains were during that time.",
