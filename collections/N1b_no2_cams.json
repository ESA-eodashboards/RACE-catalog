  "ShortDescription": "This indicator shows how key air pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), fine particles (PM2.5 and PM10), and ozone, changed over time in major European cities, using data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). These time series help us see how air quality evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the effects of lockdowns and reduced traffic. CAMS combines satellite observations, ground measurements, and advanced atmospheric models to provide reliable ‘urban background’ air-quality levels, offering a clear picture of long-term trends rather than short-term local spikes. This helps citizens understand how pollution changes across seasons and major events, and how it affects health and the environment.",
