  "description": "## Non-cargo/tanker Ship density Map\n\nThis indicator shows maps representing the total ship presence time on a 1 km grid (EEA/Inspire standards)\nfor every month from 2017-2021. The indicator is provided by the [EMODnet Human activities portal](https://www.emodnet-humanactivities.eu/view-data.php). Ship categories do not include tanker and cargo ships.\n\nThe total ship presence times are converted to average instantaneous number of ships per square km.\n\nThese maps have been made from ship reporting data of the Automatic Identification System (AIS), collected by coastal stations and satellites. \n\nEMODnet Human Activities creates vessel density maps of EU waters showing the average number of vessels of certain type (cargo, passenger, fishing etc.) in a given period within a grid cell.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eurodatacube/eodash-assets/main/collections/E13o_vessel_density_all/E13o_vessel_density_all.png\" alt=\"Image\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eurodatacube/eodash-assets/main/collections/E13o_vessel_density_all/E13o_legend.png\" alt=\"Legend\" />\n",

By mapping where these vessels were over time from 2017 to 2021, it helps people understand how everyday maritime activities changed, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how they contribute to coastal life, tourism, and local economies.",
