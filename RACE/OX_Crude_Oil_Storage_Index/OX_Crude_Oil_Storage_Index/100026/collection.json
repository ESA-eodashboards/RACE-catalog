  "description": "\n\n## European Oil Storage Index\n\nThe Oil Trading Analytics Monitor ([OTAM](https://business.esa.int/projects/otam)) utilises information processed from Satellite Earth Observations (Sat-EO) to estimate the crude oil stock variation based on floating-roof tanks. The Sat-EO includes both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Optical data.\n\nA higher contextualisation of crude oil storage information is achieved by merging maritime data such as automatic identification system (AIS) cargo tracking data with land remote sensing techniques based on Sat-EO. \n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eurodatacube/eodash-assets/main/collections/OX_Crude_Oil_Storage_Index/Rotterdam_Sentinels_animations-small.gif/)\n*Fig. 1. Animation of optical (Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) imagery of the port of Rotterdam.*\n\nThe SAR data is optimally fused with maritime data into a product tailored to the targeted user group of oil analysts and oil researchers.\n\nThe Oil Storage Index is provided by [OILX](https://www.oilx.co/) in cooperation with [ARESYS](https://www.aresys.it/). The index is a composite indicator based on EO (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2), AIS and other data, describing the status of crude oil storage utilisation for 4 geographical clusters (UK/Ireland, ARA+Germany, CEE, Southern Europe).\n\nEach cluster contains a variable number of sites, located in different countries.\n\n### The four European clusters:\n\n- **The UK/Ireland Cluster** The UK/Ireland cluster includes [UK](https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/country/GBR) and [Ireland](https://www.eia.gov/international/overview/country/IRL) and plays an important logistical role as many of the oil fields in the UK Continental Shelf pump their oil production onshore to terminals alongside the UK coastline.\n\n- **The North-West Europe Cluster** includes [Belgium](https://www.eia.gov/international/overview/country/BEL), [Netherlands](https://www.eia.gov/international/overview/country/NLD), and [North West Germany](https://www.eia.gov/international/overview/country/DEU). It is the largest refining hub in Europe. Rotterdam is the largest port in Europe and the starting point of pipelines into surrounding countries. Besides that, the ARA (Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp) triangle is the key oil trading hub for all of Europe and the starting point for all oil barge traffic along the Rhine river.\n\n- **The Central Eastern Europe (CEE) Cluster** includes [Croatia](https://www.eia.gov/international/overview/country/HRV), [Austria](https://www.eia.gov/international/overview/country/AUT), and [North East Italy](https://www.eia.gov/international/overview/country/ITA). CEE is a largely landlocked inland territory in oil markets that used to receive most of is crude oil supplies from Russia and increasingly has seen receiving crude also from Croatia and North East Italy.\n\n- **The Southern Europe Cluster** includes [Greece](https://www.eia.gov/international/overview/country/GRC), and [Italy](https://www.eia.gov/international/overview/country/ITA). Southern European countries like Greece, Italy and Spain are home to large refining systems and are strategically located close to oil producing countries (e.g. Algeria and Libya) and pipeline endpoints (e.g. from Azerbaijan, Northern Iraq, Suez Canal).\n\n### How to read the graphs:\n\nGraphs are provided for each Site in every Cluster. \nQualitative levels of the oil levels in the floating-roof tanks are presented as coloured points <span style=\"background-color:orange\"> LOW </span>/<span style=\"background-color:#44A0F6\"> REGULAR </span>/<span style=\"background-color:#F65055\"> HIGH</span> on top of the aggregated data at Cluster level. The lines represent the Cluster Storage Utilisation (grey line) and its Monthly Average (black line). \n\nReferences: \nhttps://www.eia.gov/ \n\nIn case you have further questions on the content of this indicator please contact [info@oilx.co]\n",
