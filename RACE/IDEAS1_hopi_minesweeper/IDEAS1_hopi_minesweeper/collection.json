These fields represent areas with high health risk, can you flag them all correctly?\n\nIf finished, your score is based on the time you spend to correctly mark all high health risk areas, if you opened a mine field your score will be based on percentage of uncovered area.\n\n## Heads-up\nThe underlying data has been derived using Earth Observation data, for more information have a look at the <a href=\"./?indicator=IND1_1\">original indicator</a>.\nThe game regions changes daily, so come back tomorrow for more!

  "shortdescription": "This interactive game lets you explore urban health risks from air pollution and extreme heat in a playful way. Using the Health-Oriented Urban Heat and Pollution Index (HOUHPI), the minesweeper-style game challenges you to identify high-risk areas while learning how heat, pollution, population vulnerability, and access to healthcare combine to affect health in cities. The game is based on real Earth-observation data and changes daily, encouraging users to come back and discover how risks vary across urban areas.",
