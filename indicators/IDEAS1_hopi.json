  "ShortDescription": "This indicator highlights areas in European cities where people may face higher health risks due to a combination of extreme heat, air pollution, vulnerable populations, and limited access to healthcare. By combining satellite-derived temperature, air-quality data, population information, and distance to medical facilities, it shows where heatwaves and pollution could have the strongest impact on health.",
